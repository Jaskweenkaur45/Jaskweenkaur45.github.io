                Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in the moment, bringing awareness to thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. 
                It reduces stress, improves focus, and enhances emotional well-being. Regular mindfulness practice promotes better sleep, 
                lowers blood pressure, and increases resilience. By cultivating a non-judgmental awareness, individuals can develop greater 
                self-compassion and overall mental clarity.
